## Accomplishment
- **Zijian Zhang**
  - Work with Hannah and Stuart to finish implement the recipe page. At the top of this page is a nav bar that you can go between **summary**, **ingredients** and **directions**. There are a brief describtion and picture of recipe in summary section, a list of ingredients that you can select to add in shopping list in ingredients section and a detail steps of cooking in drections section.
  - Also implement the cooking mode functioanly where there is a button on direction section of each recipe, click on that it will lead to the cooking mode where each step will be displayed seperately and users can go back and forth easily by clicking buttons below. There will also be timer in cooking mode where users can time which will be implemented later.

- **You Wu**
  - Implemented the layout of user profile page to make it meet the expected layout shown in the pitch by using various structures and properties in CSS.
  - Fixed the side panel so that it does not block those clickable buttons after it is collapsed.
  - Added a table structure to grocery list, so that the ingredient, amount, and unit can be added in the expected order, with each ingredient occupying one row.
  - Implemented other CSS code with Tiffany.

- **Tiffany Zhong**
  - Throughout this past week I worked on implementing css through the main.css file, as well as through the js files. This involved debugging the side panel because it  was previously blocking components of the page. 
  - I also worked on creating a uniform footer and header throughout all the pages. 
  - After that I worked on the css for the recipe page and home page.

- **Eamon Aalipour**
  - In recent weeks, I have continued my work as a member of the backend team solidifying the login process. More specifically, a lot of my work has been based on refactoring the code to encompass a token system for authentication. This involved shaking up quite a bit of the code and I was able to get an even stronger understanding of how frontend communicates with backend. As always, I've also participated in code reviews and helping out different folks, especially now that we're moving to a token system.
  - Moving forward, my efforts have been spend researching Firebase to host our images as well as GCP to eventually host the site itself.

  - I designed the main framework and working flow of the database class and implemented some member functions as well as integration with the frontend. I
  -  also helped Esther, Zijian, Hannah, Eamon, Martin, and Bagrat with debugging. Currently, I’m working on deploying the server on GCP.
