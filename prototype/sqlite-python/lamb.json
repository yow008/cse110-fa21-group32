A 3-hour lamb shoulder is great. A 12-hour lamb shoulder is better! The meat is even more succulent because a lower cooking temperature means less moisture loss, and better flavour infusion from the rub. The sauce is a Lamb Jus made using the braising juices so it has phenomenal flavour. Don&#39;t be intimidated, it&#39;s simple and no more difficult to make than gravy!This is an excellent make-ahead recipe for gatherings. Why? Because you can make up to 4 shoulders in one standard oven. And the room for error is also almost nil; it&#39;s almost entirely hands-off cooking that magically takes care of itself overnight. Most importantly, the meat is so juicy it reheats 100% perfectly. I cook it overnight and reheat to serve that evening.About scaling up: 2 shoulders can be cooked in one large pan with no change to cook time. 4 shoulders (2 lambs in 2 pans, on 2 shelves) takes about 14 to 15 hours.","datePublished":"2021-10-08T15:00:00+00:00","image":["https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12-Hour-Greek-Slow-Roasted-Lamb-Shoulder_4-copy.jpg","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12-Hour-Greek-Slow-Roasted-Lamb-Shoulder_4-copy.jpg?w=500&h=500&crop=1","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12-Hour-Greek-Slow-Roasted-Lamb-Shoulder_4-copy.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12-Hour-Greek-Slow-Roasted-Lamb-Shoulder_4-copy.jpg?w=480&h=270&crop=1"],"recipeYield":["5"],"prepTime":"PT10M","cookTime":"PT780M","recipeIngredient":["1.6 - 2.2kg / 3.2 - 4.4lb  lamb shoulder (, bone-in (Note 1))","2 cups water ((Note 2))","1  brown onion ((unpeeled), cut into 6 wedges (Note 3))","2 1/2 tsp fresh rosemary (, chopped (finely))","1 tbsp dried oregano","2  garlic cloves (big!)
